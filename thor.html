    <h1>The Life of Thor</h1>

    <h2> AKA Tino, Tiny, Pumpi, Poopie etc. </h2>

  <h3>
    When was he born?
  </h3>
  <p>If we're being honest, he has two birthdays. Some say it's May 15, 2013 and others say it's June 15, 2013. I have officially
    settled on June 15th. Thor was brought into his home on July 31st, 2013. Also non coincidentaly the same day that Kanye West
    dropped his album <b>"Yeezus"</b>. That day shall never be forgotten.</p>
    <br>
  <p>He begins his journey with a quick ball snipping and continues on to be the poop producing, nap taking dog he is today.</p>

  <h3>What breed is he?</h3>
  <p>Some may agree he is a mix between a lion and a panda. But in reality, he is just a mix between a Maltese
  and a Bichon Frise</p>

<h3>What are Thor's hobbies?</h3>
<p>Thor does what thor wants. He just loves to lay around, most of the time in the sun. He loves to make love to all of
  his stuffed animals <i(Everyone gets a little love from Thor)> Sometimes, Thor will get bored and move from my bedroom
  to the couch downstairs, and then move to the veranda to do some sunbathing. Thor loves to get a little tan.</p>
