  <!--Notice the "margin:10em" is also part of this style; this is telling the entire div that it will have a slight margin around the whole page-->

    For example, what does a table in HTML look like?
  </h3>

<!--this is how you start a table in HTML -->
  <table>
<tbody>

<!--this is identifying your 1st horizontal row of the table-->
<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>2</td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>5</td>
</tr>

<!--this is identifying your 2nd horizontal row of the table-->
<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>7</td>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>9</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<!--this is identifying your 3rd horizontal row of the table-->
<tr>
	<td>11</td>
	<td>12</td>
  <td>13</td>
  <td>14</td>
  <td>15</td>
</tr>
<!--this is identifying your 4th horizontal row of the table-->
<tr>
	<td>16</td>
	<td>17</td>
  <td>18</td>
  <td>19</td>
  <td>20</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
<!--ok, you're done with your table and you're closing the table element with the closing tag.-->
</table>

  <h3>Now let's take a look at images in HTML.</h3>
  <p>Remember that you have to call the link properly. So take a look at the folder structure for this example.<br>
  Ok, so we have a folder called "img" and inside that folder, there's an image called meme.jpg<br>
  To fetch this image in our code, we have to specify in our HTML that the browser needs to look inside the "img" folder and then name the image we want.<br>
  The way you write that is by saying <b>img src="img/meme.jpg"</b><br>
  <b>By the way! To bold your text just use the "b" tag!</b></p>

  <!--This is where you're calling the image-->
  <img src="img/memeislife.jpg" alt="A coding meme that makes fun of the complexity of coding" width="500" height="auto">
  <!--Notice that when you resize your browser the image doesn't automatically resize.
  Let's try to include an image that will resize by using a percentage for the width-->
<div>
  <img src="img/meme.jpg" alt="cat meme" width="50%" height="auto">
  <!--Cool! percentages can be used to make images instantly responsive! This can be anything from 1% to 100%. It's just a percentage of your total browser width.-->
</div>

</div>

<div>
  <br>
<h3>Ok. We know about tables, images, and headings. What about links?</h3>
<p>A link tag, or "a" tag, is an <b>inline element</b>. This means that when you include it in your code, it isn't going to force a new row like block elements do;
  it will fit into the rest of the line. Let's look at an example of what this looks like.
  <br>
  Ok, so we are currently still within our "p" element. Let's throw in link <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Notice how we're still in the same line?
  <p>A link will appear differently in HTML than a button will. This is what a <button>button looks like</button><br>
    BE AWARE! Buttons in HTML are intended to do something, not to take you somewhere. You'll notice that for buttons there is no href attribute;
    that's because buttons are meant to be targeted using JavaScript to make something happen. Your "a" tags are for links, and your "button" tag is for action.

<!--the hr tag is handy for creating a line-->
<hr>


<div>
<!--The style here is saying everything in this div (all this text) will be the HTML color TOMATO-->
<div style="color:Tomato">
<h3>Some more tags for typography:</h3>


<p>  <b> - Bold text</b></p>
<p>   <strong> - Important text</strong> (basically same thing as bold text)</p>
<p>   <i> - Italic text</i></p>
<p>   <em> - Emphasized text</em></p>
<p>   <small> - Smaller text</small></p>
<p>   <del> - Deleted text</del></p>
<p>   <ins> - Inserted text</ins></p>

<p>This is<sub> subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup></p>
